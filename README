The key ideas:

  1 XML elements map to key names in the dictionary
  2 Each element corresponds to a child dictionary
  3 Attribute key-value pairs are added to the element’s child dictionary
  4 Strings from text nodes are assigned to the child dictionary’s “text” key
  5 If an element name is encountered multiple times, the value of the element is set to an array of children dictionaries
